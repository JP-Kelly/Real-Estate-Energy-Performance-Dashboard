This project developed an interactive energy dashboard to visualise and analyse energy consumption data for a real estate investment company's property portfolio. Due to the developmental stage of the properties, Python was used to generate dummy data for the project. Python was also used to detect and log co-ordinates of properties using the Computer Vision library. The prototype dashboard aims to provide actionable insights into potential energy usage patterns, identify areas for energy efficiency improvements, and support informed decision-making regarding energy management.

You can view the interactive version on [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jp.kelly8457/viz/AEPGDevelopment/AEGPStory).

## Key Technologies

* **Python:** Used for scripting and mapping property coordinates based on development plans. Employed for data cleaning, manipulation, statistical analysis, and the generation of dummy energy consumption data.
* **Tableau:** Utilised to create the interactive dashboard and visualisations for effective data exploration and communication.

## Project Overview

## Project Overview

1.  **Data Generation, Acquisition, and Preparation:**
    * Since real-world energy consumption data was not yet available, Python scripts were used to generate dummy data (both daily and hourly) based on estimated energy usage patterns and property characteristics. These can be found in the [scripts folder](https://github.com/JP-Kelly/Real-Estate-Energy-Performance-Dashboard/tree/main/scripts).
    * A Python script was also developed to process property location data from image-based development plans. This involved extracting property coordinates and sizes using image processing techniques and geometric calculations. This can also be found in the [scripts folder](https://github.com/JP-Kelly/Real-Estate-Energy-Performance-Dashboard/tree/main/scripts).
    * Python was used to clean, transform, and aggregate both the generated energy data and the property data, ensuring data quality and consistency.

2.  **Data Analysis and Visualization (Tableau):**
    * Tableau was used to perform exploratory data analysis on the dummy data, identify potential trends, and calculate relevant energy performance indicators.
    * Tableau was employed to design and develop the interactive dashboard, featuring visualizations such as:
        * Interactive maps showing property locations and estimated energy consumption.
        * Charts displaying estimated energy consumption by property type, location, and time period.
        * Heatmaps comparing property energy use for different energy solutions (standard central heating vs. infrared heating).
        * Filtering and drill-down capabilities to explore data in detail.
